# Hack Computer

This repository is my implementation of the Hack computer in C++ from the [NAnd2Tetris course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer). 

[Current Documentation](Current/markdown/index.md#hackcomputer)

## Testing

The [Test directory](Test) is setup to work with [google test](https://github.com/google/googletest).

It also contains a setup for testing using GitHub actions.


## Current State

This is still a work in progress. Its on hold for the time being until I have
more time to devote to it. It doesn't really do much on the surface. The Jack
language is still very basic.
