# Hack Computer

This repository is my implementation of the Hack computer in C++ from the [NAnd2Tetris course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer). 

[Current Documentation](Current/markdown/index.md#hackcomputer)

## Testing

The [Test directory](Test) is setup to work with [google test](https://github.com/google/googletest).

It also contains a setup for testing using GitHub actions.


## Current State

It is a work in progress, and it is on hold for the time being until more time is devoted to it. I think its a neat toy
because it allows a complete perspective from code to execution.
It could easily be expanded upon and taken to the 
finish line. But at the end of the day it's only emulating the 
actual process.
