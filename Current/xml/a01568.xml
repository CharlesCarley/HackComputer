<para>Implements a circuit class library.</para><para><linebreak/>
It uses two separate implementations to compute the circuit logic.<linebreak/>
<linebreak/>
 The first implementation is written to compute the value of each circuit. I wanted to keep the chip functionality present rather than abstract it away. It links the circuits together in code and computes the value of each bit.<linebreak/>
<linebreak/>
 The second implementation is with the circuit behavior abstracted away. It replaces the circuit logic with a C++ implementation of for its operation.<linebreak/>
<linebreak/>
 The build option that toggles this behavior is <computeroutput>Hack_IMPLEMENT_BLACK_BOX</computeroutput>.<linebreak/>
