<para>This repository is my implementation of the <ref refid="namespaceHack" kindref="compound">Hack</ref> computer in C++ from the NAnd2Tetris course. It is a bit over the top and does not strictly adhere to the course. I chose to opt out of the certificate of completion instead chose to support the authors by buying the e-book. I wanted something self-contained in the end. In order to do that, the supplied tools in the course material had to be written from scratch (to some extent). </para>    </detaileddescription>
