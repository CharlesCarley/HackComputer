\mainpage HackComputer



This repository is my implementation of the Hack computer in C++ from the
NAnd2Tetris course. It is a bit over the top and does not strictly adhere to
the course. I chose to opt out of the certificate of completion instead chose
to support the authors by buying the e-book. I wanted something self-contained
in the end. In order to do that, the supplied tools in the course material had
to be written from scratch (to some extent).
