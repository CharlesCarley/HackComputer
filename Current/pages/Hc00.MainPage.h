\mainpage HackComputer

This repository is an implementation of the Hack computer in C++ from the
[NAnd2Tetris course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer).
It is a bit over the top and does not strictly adhere to the course. I chose to
opt out of the certificate of completion instead chose to support the authors by
buying the [e-book](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-second-Principles-ebook-dp-B084V7R8PT/dp/B084V7R8PT/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1650772950). 
I wanted something self-contained in the end. In order to do
that, the supplied tools in the course materials were written from scratch.
