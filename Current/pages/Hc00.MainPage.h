\mainpage HackComputer

This repository is my implementation of the Hack computer in C++ from the
[NAnd2Tetris course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer).
It is a bit over the top and does not strictly adhere to the course. I chose to
opt out of the certificate of completion instead chose to support the authors by
buying the e-book. I wanted something self-contained in the end. In order to do
that, the supplied tools in the course materials were written from scratch, to some extent.
