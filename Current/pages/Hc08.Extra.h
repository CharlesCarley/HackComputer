\brief Optional tools that are not part of the source.

\section Hc08GRM GRM files

The grammar files are for the most part reference only.They do not use any of the code generation features of the Gold Parsing Engine.
They were initially written and tested with the tool-set.

I believe it is a dead [project](http://www.goldparser.org/), but it is an awesome tool to `quickly` throw together and test grammars.
